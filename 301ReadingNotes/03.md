## *All Notes Taken From Reading Materials*

## React Docs - lists and keys

1. What does .map() return?

>>> It returns an array: 

        const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const doubled = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);
        console.log(doubled);


2. If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?

>>> You would .map(*array*) and assign it to that variable in {*array*}:

        const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
        <li>{number}</li>
        );

3. Each list item needs a unique ____.
 
 * **key**

4. What is the purpose of a key?

* Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity:

        const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
            <li key={number.toString()}>
              {number}
            </li>
        );

## The Spread Operator

1. What is the spread operator?
  
  * When ...arr is used in the function call, it ‘expands’ an iterable object arr into the list of arguments. 

2. List 4 things that the spread operator can do.

  - Copying an array
  - Concatenating or combining arrays
  - Using Math functions
  - Using an array as arguments
  - Adding an item to a list
  - Adding to state in React
  - Combining objects
  - Converting NodeList to an array

3. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

    const fruits = ['🍏','🍊','🍌','🍉','🍍']
    const moreFruits = [...fruits];
    console.log(moreFruits) // Array(5) [ "🍏", "🍊", "🍌", "🍉", "🍍" ]
    fruits[0] = '🍑'
    console.log(...[...fruits,'...',...moreFruits]) //  🍑 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍 ... 🍏 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍


4. Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

    const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
    const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]
    console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]


5. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

    const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
    const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
    const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
    console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
    const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
    objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂
