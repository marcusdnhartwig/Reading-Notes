# 13 Reading Notes

## *All Notes Taken From Reading Materials*

## CRUD Basics

1. Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?
  * to update a record through an API you would use the "put" HTTP method (side note from previous video reading, you could use Patch to update 1 parameter of an object within the database whereas put will update everything)

2. Which REST methods require an ID parameter?
  * get, put/patch, and delete require ID parameters


## Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API (Watch a Twitch streamer code an Express API in 20 minutes!)

1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?
  * *REST* apps usually use *CRUD like functions*. CRUD is create read update and delete whereas REST is Representational state transfer, an architectural style for software.

2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
  * install all your essentials
  * create your router
  * mount the router and check the CRUD get/put/delete routes
  * create a schema to validate incoming data
  * Add things to the database!
